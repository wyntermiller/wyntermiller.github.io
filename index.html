        <h2>About WKM</h2>
        <p>Wynter K Miller is a writer and editor living in San Francisco, CA. She is currently the Managing Editor at Electric Literature, and is a freelance editor. Her boyfriend is incredibly sexy and awesome and probably deserves a headrub for building this site for her. However, she probably needs to write her own bio eventually.</p>
        <p>Wynter K Miller began her editing career in academic publishing with a focus on narrative medicine and bioethics. She was a Senior Editor for the UC Davis Law Review, where she acquired and edited scholarly manuscripts for print publication. During her tenure, her own writing was recognized with four Witkin Awards for Best Essay, as well as an honorable mention for the Hopkin’s Award, awarded annually for publication of the most accomplished work. Her writing appears in Washington & Lee Law Review, Tennessee Law Review, and UC Davis Law Review, among others. Wynter also worked for several years developing and editing manuscripts now published in top-tier academic and medical journals, including the Annals of Internal Medicine and the American Journal of Bioethics. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Bioethics where she edited manuscripts, provided developmental editing for works in progress, and published her own work. </p>

        <p>Wynter now applies her editorial expertise to fiction and creative nonfiction. She was the managing editor of Forum Literary Magazine and in that capacity worked with fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and visual art. Wynter has worked at Electric Literature since 2021 and previously served as a contributing editor, Interim Books Editor, and Associate Editor. She is currently Managing Editor, working primarily on Recommended Reading, where she acquires and edits fiction. Her editorial focus is on finding and elevating work submitted via open submission; recent pieces include “The Last Unmapped Places” by Rebecca Turkewitz, “The Oracle” by Joanna Pearson, and “Group Sex” by Elisa Faison. Wynter has a JD from the UC Davis School of Law and lives in San Francisco.</p>
